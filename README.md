# 🚗 Fuel Consumption Predictor

An interactive web application to predict vehicle fuel consumption based on engine specifications using **Polynomial Regression**.



## 📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes vehicle data (like engine size and cylinders) to predict fuel efficiency. I used **Polynomial Regression** instead of simple linear regression to better capture the non-linear relationship between engine size and fuel consumption.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Web Framework:** Streamlit
* **ML Algorithm:** Polynomial Regression (Scikit-Learn)
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization: Matplotlib 

##  Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/tanishaasaklani/fuel-consumption-predictor.git](https://github.com/tanishaasaklani/fuel-consumption-predictor.git)
   cd fuel-consumption-predictor
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   
## 📊 Model Overview
The model uses Polynomial Regression to capture non-linear relationships between the independent variables (like Engine Size) and the dependent variable (Fuel Consumption). This approach allows for a more accurate fit compared to simple linear regression when the data shows a curved trend.
